## Setup your project

Your project needs to have two entry points. In classic, non-server-side-rendered Vue apps, you
often have one entry point which includes all other files of your project (implicitly or explicitly)
and Webpack creates a bundle based on that entry point. With Server Side Rendering you need two
bundles, one for your client and one for your server. Those bundles run the same app (your project)
but set them up in a different manner.

For the client you need to load your app and mount it to a DOM-element in your website. For the server
you prefetch some data, run your app, and render your whole app to a (HTML-)string that you send to the
user as your markup.

VUSSR, by default, expects those entry files to be placed in a `src` folder with the following filenames.
If that file structure isn't for you you can change this by setting up a configuration.

```
root
 âˆŸ src
    âˆŸ entry.client.js
    âˆŸ entry.server.js
```

ðŸ‘‰ [Please refer to Configuration to learn how to change those paths](./configuration.md)

You can now add npm script to you `package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "vussr serve",
    "build": "vussr build",
    "start": "vussr start"
  }
}
```
