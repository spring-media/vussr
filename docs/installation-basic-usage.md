# Installation & Basic Usage

## Installation

Just install VUSSR via npm

```console
npm i vussr --save # yarn add vussr
```

## Run Commands

VUSSR is a cli tool which means once you have installed it in your dependencies you can use it as a
command in your npm scripts. For an example, scroll up to [Add npm Scripts](#add-npm-scripts).

VUSSR has three commands:

| Command | Description                                                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serve` | This will start your application using a Webpack DevServer and recompile your code on file changes |
| `build` | This will create a production build that you can use with the start command to run your app        |
| `start` | This will take a production build and run it with an Express server                                |

`serve` and `start` can be run with the additional _nock_ parameters. With these parameters, you can record
requests and responses made on the server side and replay those requests later so you can work when you're
offline or a service you depend on is offline

| Command                 | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--nock`                | This will start your server in nock mode, meaning requests made by the server will be,answered locally by previously recorded requests of the same kind |
| `--nock --record`       | This will record all requests made on the server side and store them to JSON files so,you can replay them later with the nock command                   |
| `--nockPath [nockPath]` | You can add this parameter to `--nock` and `--nock --record` to provide a path to,where the nocked data should be read from and written to              |

You can run `build` with these parameters but they will have no effect.

## Setup your project

Your project needs to have two entry points. In classic, non-server-side-rendered Vue apps, you
often have one entry point which includes all other files of your project (implicitly or explicitly)
and Webpack creates a bundle based on that entry point. With Server Side Rendering you need two
bundles, one for your client and one for your server. Those bundles run the same app (your project)
but set them up in a different manner.

For the client you need to load your app and mount it to a DOM-element in your website. For the server
you prefetch some data, run your app, and render your whole app to a (HTML-)string that you send to the
user as your markup.
